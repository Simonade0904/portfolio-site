                    am able to provide a verbal walkthrough and share some insights.</h2>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>This is a project that I took on during my product management internship at JD.COM, One of China’s
                largest domestic e-commerce site and logistics network. Our product team discovered that the 2-day
                retention rate for the app indicates a lack of user stickiness and begs the question of whether our app
                is making a good first impression to e-book enthusiasts.</p>

            <p>That’s where I came in. I designed a tool to incentivize the new users to engage in the reading app in
                the first few days that they visit.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Defining the Tool</h2>
            <p>Incentivization can take several forms, among which are a direct modification to existing services, a
                reward program, and seasonal activities. Modifying existing services demanded a high engineering cost
                and seasonal in-app promotion activites would put lots of pressure on our limited marketing and content
                specialists, so we opted for the reward program.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Making the Program</h2>
            <p>How many days should the reward program be and how should it be structured?</p>

            <p>To answer this, I broke down the app’s main task flow to understand how we could guide a new user. It
                turned out that 5 was the magic number and we chose that as the number of days the program would last.
                Below are specific tasks that users would go through.</p>

            <img class="single-image" src="images/jd.com/taskflow.png" alt="the-steps-i-took-to-create-the-program">

            <p>I then created a reward program where each day, a user would accomplish a specific task to get their
                reward for the day. Throughout the five days, the tasks get more involved and the reward grows until it
                peaks on the fifth day.</p>
